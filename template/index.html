                Before there were computers, there were algorithms. But now that there are computers, there are even
                more
                algorithms, and algorithms lie at the heart of computing.
                This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of computer algorithms. It presents
                many algorithms and covers them in considerable
                depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. We
                have tried to keep explanations elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage
                or mathematical rigor.
                Each chapter presents an algorithm, a design technique, an application area, or a
                related topic. Algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to
                be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The book contains 244
                figures—many with multiple parts—illustrating how the algorithms work. Since
                we emphasize efficiency as a design criterion, we include careful analyses of the
                running times of all our algorithms.
                The text is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in
                algorithms or data structures. Because it discusses engineering issues in algorithm
                design, as well as mathematical aspects, it is equally well suited for self-study by
                technical professionals.
                In this, the third edition, we have once again updated the entire book. The
                changes cover a broad spectrum, including new chapters, revised pseudocode, and
                a more active writing style
